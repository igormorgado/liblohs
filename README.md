LIBLOHS is a library (driver) to control LOHS Readers (for now there is support only to 3x models... more in the future). Now it's under development and it's only for developers. (I hope a fully functional release very soon).

Changelog:
    0.01:
            - Initial release/freshmeat release
            - Developers only release
    0.02:
            - Code completly rewriten.
    0.03:
            - Added timeval struct support in lohs.c:strRX()
            - Bug Fixed: lohs.c:strTX missing strncpy()

I'm without a LOHS scanner right now, if you want some kind of development, please borrow a reader to me. 

Thanks to:
